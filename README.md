The "Simple Grammar Checker" is a basic web application designed to assist users in identifying potential grammar issues related to 
capitalization at the beginning of sentences. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project provides a user-friendly interface where individuals can input text. 
Upon clicking the "Check Grammar" button, the application splits the text into sentences and evaluates whether each sentence starts with a capital letter.

Key Features:

Input Text Area: Users can input paragraphs or sentences into a designated text area.

Grammar Check Functionality: The application employs a simple grammar check algorithm to identify sentences lacking proper capitalization at their beginnings.

User Feedback: Immediate feedback is provided to users, indicating whether their input adheres to the grammatical rule or if corrections are needed.

Clear and Responsive Design: The interface is straightforward, ensuring ease of use, and the design is responsive to various screen sizes.

While this grammar checker is rudimentary and focuses solely on capitalization, it serves as an educational tool to highlight a common grammatical rule. Users can utilize this application to improve their awareness of correct sentence structure, particularly the need for capitalization at the start of each sentence.
